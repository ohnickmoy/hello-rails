# Hello, Rails!

This is a basic Ruby on Rails App to display "Hello, Rails" on your local machine

## Prerequisites

This guides assumes you're running this on Mac OS X.

At minimum, you'll need docker on your machine to build and run the containers. Mac machines use Docker Desktop. 

Once you have that ready, run

docker compose build
```
then
```
docker compose up
```

The Makefile is there for your convenience to short hand some of these commands, e.g. `make build`, or `make up`
